            <td><p>Co-Founder</p><p>Mike Bocker grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and studies Applied Mathematics with a focus in data science at Harvard College. Before Harvard, Mike spent the majority of his time playing sports (lacrosse and football) with the dream of becoming a professional athlete. Unfortunately, due to a series of injuries during his senior year of high school, he was unable to make good on that dream. This past summer, he worked for MATTER, a healthcare startup incubator based out of Chicago. He spent his time there connecting large corporations to startups based on market research and the corporationsâ€™ pre-established strategies. As for hobbies, Mike is an avid outdoorsmen, part-time cello player, and rugby enthusiast.</p></td>
