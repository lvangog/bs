From a high level, we aim to be building a platform to which advertisers can upload their advertisement
material while service providers can earn money for running this platform to their clients. We are taking
Uber drivers as the first use case.

For advertisers:
- Create an account by clicking the register button
- You will be prompted to create a username and password; ensure the checkbox is checked
- The homepage will be reloaded and new tabs 'Account' and 'Upload' will be available
- The account page displays the total balance to date, along with how often your ads have run and payments
  due which are made to our financial office
- The upload page will be where you insert your youtube link to the advertisement

For users:
- Create an account by clicking the register button
- You will be prompted to create a username and password
- The homepage will be reloaded with new tabs 'Account' and 'Run Ads'
- The account page will be fully set up once linked with your Uber account and will calculate your income
  based on how much time you have been driving for; withdrawals can be made by setting up a direct deposit
  with our financial office
- The Run Ads page will be where the advertisements will run on a carousel through 15 second intervals from
  one to the next from the platform's database

For the viewer in the Uber rides, the advertisements will rotate through on a carousel until the viewer
picks the ad they wish to view at which point the advertisement will play and the rotation will start again.

This platform, as you may notice, has limited capacity without yet being synchronized with users Uber accounts.
We also aim to improve features moving forward but this this serves as an initial minimal viable product (MVP)
for displayal purposes.
